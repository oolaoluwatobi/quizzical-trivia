[scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)'s Learn React project 

Questions and answers are pulled from the [Open trivia database](https://opentdb.com/), then rendered on the quizzical trivia app 

Once the user has made all of their selections, they can click "check answers" then the app will score the quiz and allow them play again if they want.
